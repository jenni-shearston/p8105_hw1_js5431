```

####Problem 1

Creating a random sample variable

```{r}
ran_sam = rnorm(10, 0, 5)
```

Creating a logical vector

```{r}
bigger2 = ran_sam > 2
```

Creating a character vector

```{r}
animal = c("fish", "dog", "cat", "dolphin", "elephant", "dog", "cow", "fish", "fish", "dolphin")
```

Creating a factor vector

```{r}
animal_f = factor(animal)
```

Creating a data frame comprised of the above four vectors

```{r}
p1_df = data.frame(ran_sam, bigger2, animal, animal_f)
```

Taking the mean of each variable in the data frame

```{r}
mean(ran_sam)
mean(bigger2)
```

*Notes: I am able to take the mean of the ran_sam (random sample variable) and bigger2 (logical vector) variables becuase they are both numeric, but not the animal or animal_f variables becuase they are character vectors.*
