Problem 1
---------

#### Creating variables

Creating a random sample variable

``` r
ran_sam = rnorm(10, 0, 5)
```

Creating a logical vector

``` r
bigger2 = ran_sam > 2
```

Creating a character vector

``` r
animal = c("fish", "dog", "cat", "dolphin", "elephant", "dog", "cow", "fish", "fish", "dolphin")
```

Creating a factor vector

``` r
animal_f = factor(animal)
```

#### Creating a data frame comprised of the above four vectors

``` r
p1_df = tibble(
  ran_sam,
  bigger2,
  animal,
  animal_f
  )
```

#### Taking the mean of each variable in the data frame

``` r
mean(ran_sam)
```

    ## [1] -0.2577623

``` r
mean(bigger2)
```

    ## [1] 0.3

Notes: I am able to take the mean of the ran\_sam (random sample variable) and bigger2 (logical vector) variables becuase they are both numeric, but not the animal or animal\_f variables becuase they are character vectors.

#### Applying the `as.numeric` function

``` r
as.numeric(bigger2)
as.numeric(animal)
as.numeric(animal_f)
```

Notes: The logical and factor variables can be coerced, while using the `as.numeric` function on the character variable results in NA for each observation. This occurs because the logical and factor variable both already have a numeric component of some type, while the character variable does not.

#### Converting variable types

``` r
factor(animal)
```

    ##  [1] fish     dog      cat      dolphin  elephant dog      cow     
    ##  [8] fish     fish     dolphin 
    ## Levels: cat cow dog dolphin elephant fish

``` r
as.numeric(animal)
```

    ## Warning: NAs introduced by coercion

    ##  [1] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA

``` r
as.character(animal_f)
```

    ##  [1] "fish"     "dog"      "cat"      "dolphin"  "elephant" "dog"     
    ##  [7] "cow"      "fish"     "fish"     "dolphin"

``` r
as.numeric(animal_f)
```

    ##  [1] 6 3 1 4 5 3 2 6 6 4

Notes: When the character variable is converted to a factor variable it is given levls, but when it is then converted to a numeric variable NA results. When the factor variable is converted to a character variable this seems to go smoothly, and can then also be transferred into a numeric variable such that each unique category in the variable is assigned a number

Problem 2
---------

#### Creating the described dataframe

``` r
x = rnorm(1000)
y = rnorm(1000)
logical = (x+y) > 0
logical_n = as.numeric(logical)
logical_f = factor(logical_n)

graphing_df = tibble(
  x,
  y,
  logical,
  logical_n,
  logical_f
  )
```

Notes: The dataframe called "graphing\_df" has a size of n=''

Write a short description of your vector using inline R code, including: \* the size of the dataset \* the mean and median of x \* the proportion of cases for which the logical vector is TRUE
